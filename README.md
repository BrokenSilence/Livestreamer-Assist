# Livestreamer-Assist
Programs made in AutoIT for Livestreamer

The Clipboard version just runs Livestreamer after if you open the program, with the link that is on the clipboard.
So in order to use it, first you copy the link, then you open the program.

The Multibrowser version checks if Livestreamer is installed, and offers to download the setup if not.
After it's installed (or was already), it asks which brower you're using (TODO: Check which is open, and only ask if both are open).
It will then offer you the choice of choosing a letter of your keyboard to use with CTRL to "trigger" it. (Suggestion: use 'b')
When it triggers, it copies the URL and runs just like the Clipboard version.

Future versions should be able to:
1. Allow selection of other qualities other than Best.
2. Save Settings locally (so it doesn't ask everytime it's launched).
